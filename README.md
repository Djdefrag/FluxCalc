## About Fluent-Python-Calculator:
  A very simple calculator with a modern UI made in Python thanks for the stunning [Sun-Valley-ttk-theme](https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme) and Segoe UI Variable font. This is my first project ever in my life so feel free to open an issue or pull requests to help me finish the project!
  
## Use the calculator
1. **If you don't have anything and want to check out my project:** <br>
⚠️ Currently antivirus marked it as a virus (and of course, it's not) because I converted it into .exe using pyinstaller, if you still think it is a virus, check the python file.
- Check [releases](https://github.com/HuyHung1408/Fluent-Python-Calculator/releases) for the Fluent.Calculator.zip and extract it, double click the exe file to run.
- One more note, do not delete the theme folder, the tcl file and the ico file, all of them is important for Fluent-Python-Calculator to work correctly!

2. **If you have have a code editor (VS code, Notepad ++,..) and Python installed:**
- Download the file in release
