## About Fluent-Python-Calculator:
  A very simple calculator with a modern UI made in Python thanks for the stunning [Sun-Valley-ttk-theme](https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme) and Segoe UI Variable font. This is my first project ever in my life so feel free to open an issue or pull requests to help me finish the project!
  
## Use the calculator
- Make sure you have a code editor (VS code, Notepad ++,..) and Python installed.   
- Download the file in release
- You can double click to run the program or open with a code editor to edit it
