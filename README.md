## About Fluent-Python-Calculator:
  A very simple calculator with a modern UI made in Python thanks for the stunning [Sun-Valley-ttk-theme](https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme) and Segoe UI Variable font. This is my first project ever in my life so feel free to open an issue or pull requests to help me finish the project!
  
## Use the calculator
1. Check [releases](https://github.com/HuyHung1408/Fluent-Python-Calculator/releases) for the Fluent.Calculator.zip and extract it, double click the exe file to run. <br>
⚠️ Currently antivirus marked it as a virus (and of course, it's not) because I converted it into .exe using pyinstaller, if you still think it is a virus, check the python file.
- One more note, do not delete the theme folder, the tcl file, the ico file, and config file, all of them is important for Fluent-Python-Calculator to work correctly!
