To have mica effect, we need another nice program called [MicaForEveryone](https://github.com/minusium/MicaForEveryone):
- Just open Fluent Python Calculator first then open MicaForEveryone, that's simple <br>

Notice: It's not a nice method at all, because it have some limitations when you try to change dark/light theme for the third time. I will try to add Mica directly into the app in future updates, this method should work just like a placeholder for now.
